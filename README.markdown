Gist: The Python 3.0 Script
===========================

Works great with Gist: The Website.

Ported the Ruby script to Python 2 and 3, and added some features.

Also supports:

 * Passing multiple files as arguments
 * Creating a gist from STDIN
 * Auto file type detection via ext
 * Read support and clone support

Installation
------------

You need to set the GitHub config options to use this properly:
http://github.com/guides/local-github-config

As for real installation, you don't want to do that yet.

Usage
-----

	# create a gist from one or more files
	gist.py [-p] file [file2 file3...]
	
	# create a gist from stdin, giving if a filename
	cal | gist.py -i cal.txt
	
	# clone the repostiories of one or more gists
	gist.py -c id [id2 id3...]
	
	# display the text contents of a gist
	gist.py -r id

TODO
----

* Support for reading private gists.
* Use official API wherever possible.
* Automatically detect if you attempt to clone one of your own gists,
  and use the private clone URL if so. Give overrides to force private
  or public clone attempts, though. Maybe. Think about this, at least.
* Allow stdin-created files to have types without names.
