Gist: The Python 3.0 Script
===========================

Works great with Gist: The Website!

This is the Python 3.0 version of this script, derived from the Ruby and
Python 2 versions.

Usage
-----

	# create a gist from one or more files
	./gist.py [-p] file [file2 file3...]
	
	# create a gist from stdin, giving if a filename
	cal | ./gist.py -i cal.txt
	
	# clone the repostiories of one or more gists
	./gist.py -c id [id2 id3...]
	
	# display the text contents of a gist
	./gist.py -r id

Installation
------------

You need to set the GitHub config options to use this properly.
[Instructions are available
](http://github.com/guides/local-github-config) in the GitHub guides.

	curl http://github.com/JeremyBanks/gist/raw/master/3.0/gist.py > gist
	chmod 755 gist
	sudo mv gist /usr/local/bin/gist

Before you decide to install this, a word of caution: This is currently
under rapid development, and code only trivially tested before being
pushed here. Functionality may change or be broken at any time.

TODO
----

* Support for reading private Gists
* Use official API wherever possible
* Allow private cloning of Gists
  * Add flags to force using the public or private clone URLs
  * Detect if you are cloning one of your own Gists and default to using
    the private URL if so
* Allow `stdin` files to have types without names
